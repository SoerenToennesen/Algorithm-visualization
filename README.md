# Algorithm-visualization
Interactive algorithm visualization on a website.

The current project is deployed and hosted here on GitHub on the following link:

https://soerentoennesen.github.io/Algorithm-visualization/

## Features

The website features various algorithms and data structures; pathfinding, search, sort and data structures. Currently, some data structure visualization is missing. Data structures will showcase querying, inserts and deletions in selected data structures.

### Future work

A multi-agent pathfinding system would also be interesting as more complicated solution extension, but might require a separate (micro) service to encapsualte such an AI.

## Motivation

I am a huge fan of data structures and algorithms - in particular in complex settings such as MAS or distributed systems, in addition to learning by visualization and implementation. Therefore, this project serves the purpose of helping me understand selected algorithms, showcase them in a fun and immersive setting, where a bunch of different states are present and has to happen in parallel or sequentially.

## Demo

*Note the edges of the screen function as walls, which are dynamically calculated based on your screen size and/or zoom. The edges of your screen also determine how many possible sort and search entries you have (in terms of pixels of width and height).
