# Algorithm-visualization
Interactive algorithm visualization on a website.

The current project is deployed here on GitHub on the following link:

https://soerentoennesen.github.io/Algorithm-visualization/

## Features

The website (will) features various algorithms and data structures. Currently, the boilerplate code for the website setup and animation is implemented, on top of 4 algorithms. This is a project that is expected to be extended for several more algorithms (including data model algorithms), in addition to showcasing query, inserts and deletions in selected data structures, the latter of which hasn't been implemented as of yet.

Finally, some multi-agent system pathfinding would also be interesting, but might require a separate (micro) service to encapsualte such an AI.

## Motivation

I am a huge fan of data structures and algorithms - in particular in complex settings such as MAS or distributed systems, in addition to learning by visualization and implementation. Therefore, this project serves the purpose of helping me understand selected algorithms, showcase them in a fun and immersive setting, where a bunch of different states are present and has to happen in parallel or sequentially.

## Examples (not updated to the latest changes)



### Below, the BFS search is shown:

*Note this algorithm is much more computationally expensive than the rest, so there are restrictions and warnings when selecting the goal node.

### Below, the DFS search is shown:

*Note the edges of the screen function as wells, which are dynamically calculated based on your screen size and/or zoom.

### Below, the A* search is shown:
